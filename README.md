[![Project Tracker](https://img.shields.io/badge/repo%20status-Project%20Tracker-lightgrey)](https://wiki.hthompson.dev/en/project-tracker)

This repository is a collection of scripts that I've either created or modified, to complete the different sections of the [Webgoat](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat) project. "WebGoat is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by OWASP designed to teach web application security lessons."
